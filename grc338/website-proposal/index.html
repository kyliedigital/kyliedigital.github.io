         <h1>Final project proposal</h1>
         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Blind Tiger </p>
         <!--Change it to the name of the company-->
         <p>Blind Tiger is a workwear brand that redefines “office attire”. We make pieces for creative professionals who want to feel like themselves at work. Our approach blends clean, professional structure with personality and edge, so you don’t have to choose between being taken seriously and expressing who you are. Blind Tiger is about showing up confidently, creatively, and on your own terms.
         </p>
         <!--Short description of the company-->
         <h2>Target audience</h2>
         <p>Our audience is made up of modern professionals working across creative industries — designers, marketers, architects, stylists, strategists, founders, and cultural thinkers — who operate within structured environments but reject traditional corporate uniformity.
         </p>
         <!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->
         <p>They value individuality as much as credibility, and see personal style as an extension of their perspective and work. They move fluidly between client meetings, studios, presentations, and industry events, needing clothing that communicates authority without compromising personality. For them, officewear isn’t about fitting in — it’s about showing up intentionally, confidently, and creatively in every room they enter.</p>

            <!-- Home, About us, Contact, etc. -->
            <p>     Blind Tiger is a platform for creative minds navigating professional spaces. </p>
            <p>     We reinterpret office attire through the lens of contemporary culture — merging structure with experimentation, polish with personality.</p>
            <p>     Our pieces sit at the intersection of structure and self-expression. Tailoring with intention. Silhouettes with personality. Professional, but never impersonal.</p>
            <p>     We believe the workplace is not a stage where identity is muted — it’s a space where ideas take shape. Your clothes should speak before you do, and echo long after.</p>
            <p>     Blind Tiger is building a community of professionals who believe creativity belongs in every room they enter.</p>
